## XPATH

Xpath is dedfined as XML path.
It is a syntax or language for finding any element on the web page using path expression.
Xpath is used to find the location of any element on a webpage using HTML DOM structure.
Xpath can be used to navigate through elemnets and attributes in DOM.
Xpath is an address of the element.

## Type of Xpath

1) Absolute/Full Xpath
